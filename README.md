# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning and Attention

## Objective
To build and rigorously evaluate deep learning models with attention mechanisms
for multivariate time series forecasting.

## Models Compared
- Exponential Smoothing (Statistical Baseline)
- Standard LSTM
- LSTM with Additive Attention

## Evaluation Metrics
RMSE, MAE, SMAPE on a held-out test set.

## Experimental Protocol
70% Train / 15% Validation / 15% Test split.
Hyperparameter tuning performed using validation loss.
